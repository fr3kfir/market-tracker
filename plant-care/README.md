# צמחייה 🌱 — Plant Care

A mobile-first web app (PWA, Hebrew/RTL) for growing plants at home, on the balcony and in the garden:

- **Photo → species ID**: common name (Hebrew/English), scientific name, family, confidence and alternatives.
- **Health scan**: a health score and status, plus each detected problem by category
  (light, over/under-watering, soil/drainage, pests such as aphids/mealybugs/spider mites, disease,
  nutrients, temperature, humidity, pot/roots), what in the photo points to it, and step-by-step treatment.
- **Care guide**: light, water, soil, humidity, temperature, fertilizer, repotting, pet toxicity and
  best spot, fitted to the Israeli climate, the current season and where the plant grows.
- **My plants**: save plants, track watering ("I watered now" plus a next-watering reminder),
  run follow-up scans and browse each plant's scan history.

Identification and diagnosis use Claude (vision) on the server. The plant collection
lives in the browser's localStorage.

## Run locally

```bash
cd plant-care
npm install
cp .env.example .env   # paste your ANTHROPIC_API_KEY
npm run dev            # UI on http://localhost:5173, API on :3002
```

To use the phone camera during development, run `npx vite --host` and open the LAN address on your phone.

## Deploy (Vercel)

1. Import the repo in Vercel and set **Root Directory** to `plant-care`.
2. Settings → Environment Variables → add `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`.
3. Deploy, then on your phone use "Add to Home Screen" to install it as an app.

## Structure
